# SMS-Spam-Classifier
The SMS-Spam-Classifier project utilizes TensorFlow's natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to create separate classification model. A deep learning model is trained using a pre-labeled dataset. This model is designed to learn patterns, features, and characteristics specific to spam messages, enabling it to make informed predictions about new, unseen messages.
